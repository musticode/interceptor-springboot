# Interceptor Demo

- The interceptor, similar to a filter, is a practical implementation of aspect-oriented programming (AOP), which is a programming paradigm focused on modularizing cross-cutting concerns.

- Interceptors can be used for tasks like logging requests before they reach the Controller or modifying configurations dynamically.

- In Spring, every incoming request to a Controller passes through one or more interceptors (if configured) before reaching the Controller for processing.
